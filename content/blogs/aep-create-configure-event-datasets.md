10. On the right pane, click the Profile key to enable the new dataset to be part of ExperiencePlatform's Real- time Customer Profile. You will not be able to enable the Profile as the schemafrom which the dataset is created, was not enabled for Profile.

Note: If the schema on which the dataset is created is not enabled for Profile, then you will not be able to enable the Profile for the dataset as well.
