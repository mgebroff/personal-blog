Adobe Journey Optimizer helps companies deliver connected, contextual, and personalized experiences to their customers. The customer journey is the entire process of a customerâ€™s interactions with the brand, from the first moment of contact until the customer leaves. It starts with the awareness phase, where the customer learns about the brand and starts engaging. The customer will then further interact with the brand, visit online and physical sites, and make purchases, send messages or post reviews.

Adobe Journey Optimizer is built natively on Adobe Experience Platform and combines a unified, real-time customer profile, an API-first open framework, centralized offer decisioning, and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for personalization and optimization. Journey Optimizer allows brands to intelligently determine the next best interaction with scale, speed, and flexibility across the entire customer journey. With Adobe Journey Optimizer, companies can create and deliver both scheduled marketing campaigns (such as weekly promotions for a retail store) and tailored individual communications (like a push notification for an item that a loyalty app customer may have looked at that was previously out of stock) within the same application.
